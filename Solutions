"""
Exercise 1.1: Now that you've run your first program, try the following:
​
- Change the message to anything you want
- Repeat the code on multiple lines to output several messages
- Find out what happens when you remove different parts of the code (e.g. brackets)
- Don't worry if something unexpected happens. Think about what you changed and why it might have caused it to happen.

Practice the following operations in the console: 
​
5 - 6
8 * 9
6 / 2
5 / 0	# zero division error
5.0 / 2
5 % 2
2 * (10 + 3)
2 ** 4

What does each one do and what is its output?
Are there any outputs you didn't expect?

"Cat" + " videos"

"Cat" * 3
"Cat" + 3
​
"Cat".upper()
"Cat".lower()
​
"the lord of the rings".title()

What is the output for each one and why?
One of them causes an exception. Read the exception message. What do you think it means?

Errors and casting objects into different types

### EXERCISE 7 ###
​
"""
In a new Python file called cat_food.py, create a program that calculates how many cans of cat food you need to feed 10 cats
​
Your will need:
​
A variable for the number of cats
A variable for the number of cans each cat eats in a day
A print() function to output the result
Extension: change the calculation to work out the amount needed for 7 days
​
# --------------------
Example solution below
​
# cats = 10
# cans = 2
#
# total_cans = cats * cans
#
# output = str(cats) + " cats eat " + str(total_cans) + " cans"
# print(output)

"""
Perform string formatting, so that your final sentence looks like this:
guests = ["Mary", "Pete", "Eoin"]
​
Result:
"We are going to cinema with my classmates: Mary, Pete, Eoin and me"
​
Example solution below:
(We can use string interpolation and join() function to build this sentence)
​
# guests = ["Mary", "Pete", "Eoin"]
​
# print("We are going to cinema with my classmates: {names} and me.".format(names=', '.join(guests)))

S = 'ABCDEFGHI'
print(S[2:7])

S = 'Hippopotamus'
print(S[-7:-2])

S = 'ABCDEFGHI'
print(S[2:-5])
print(S[2:4])
print(S[-7:-5])
​
S = 'ABCDEFGHI'
print(S[::2])
​
​
Slice at Beginning & End
​
Omitting the start index starts the slice from the index. Meaning, S[:stop] is equivalent to S[0:stop]
Omitting the stop index extends the slice to the end of the string. Meaning, S[start:] is equivalent to S[start:len(S)]
​
# Slice first three characters from the string
S = 'ABCDEFGHI'
print(S[:3]) 
​
​
# Slice last three characters from the string
S = 'ABCDEFGHI'
print(S[6:])
​
​
Reverse a String
You can reverse a string by omitting both start and stop indices and specifying a step as -1.
​
S = 'ABCDEFGHI'
print(S[::-1])
​
S = 'Code First Girls'
print(S[::-1])
